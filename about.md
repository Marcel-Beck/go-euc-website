{{site.title}} is an independent community initiative, focused on researching areas in the End-User Computing (EUC) space. These researches vary from hands-on experiences, implementation best practices to performance impacts and so on.

All those insights are published on the {{site.title}} platform, with and for the community. Knowledge is power, and by sharing all our insights {{site.title}} will share this knowledge. The goal of {{site.title}} is to be the platform where people in the IT industry can gain their “Powers”.

{{site.title}} is not just a publication platform, it is also a lab environment running any solution we desire. With those resources, we are capable to research all kind of EUC solutions. One of the key aspects of {{site.title}} is reproducibility, therefore {{site.title}} decided to rent dedicated hardware. With our infrastructure design publicly available, everybody is able to reproduce the same results.

As the {{site.title}} platform contains serious hardware, this cannot be done without our main facilitator, ICT-Partners. ICT-Partners provides the capabilities to host this platform.
